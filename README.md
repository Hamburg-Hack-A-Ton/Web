# Hamburg Hack a Ton 
*an idea by @JackatDJL*

**Hamburg Hack a Ton is not affiliated with the city of Hamburg or The Hack Foundation**
**The Hackathon is in the stage of planning!**

## Why a Hackathon and Why Hamburg
In Northern Germany, there are hardly any hackathons, and I want to start a movement to motivate students and young people to learn about it. For example, at my school, almost no one is interested in it.
By organizing a hackathon in Hamburg, we aim to create a platform where young minds can come together, collaborate, and innovate. Hackathons provide a unique opportunity for students to apply their theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, work on real-world problems, and develop solutions that can have a tangible impact. 

Moreover, participating in hackathons helps students develop essential skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and time management. It also exposes them to the latest technologies and trends in the industry, which can be incredibly beneficial for their future careers.

We believe that by fostering a culture of innovation and creativity, we can inspire the next generation of tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs in Northern Germany. Join us in making Hamburg a hub for technological advancement and collaborative learning.
