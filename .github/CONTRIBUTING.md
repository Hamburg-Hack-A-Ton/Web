## How to contribute to Hamburg Hack A Ton

### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead refer to our [security policy](https://your-project.org/security).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-project/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-project/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:

  - [**Module A** issues](https://github.com/your-project/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/module_a.md)
  - [**Module B** issues](https://github.com/your-project/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/module_b.md)
  - [**Generic template** for other issues](https://github.com/your-project/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/generic.md)

- For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://your-project.org/contributing/reporting-an-issue).

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Your Project](https://your-project.org/contributing) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the project will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/your-project/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change in the [project-core mailing list](https://discuss.your-project.org/c/project-core) and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

- We generally reject changes to core extensions. Those changes should be proposed in the [project issue tracker instead](https://bugs.your-project.org/issues), as we don't want to conflict with future versions.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use the project in the [project-talk mailing list](https://discuss.your-project.org/c/project-talk).

### **Do you want to contribute to the project documentation?**

- Please read [Contributing to the Project Documentation](https://your-project.org/contributing/documentation).

Your Project is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join [the team](https://contributors.your-project.org)!
